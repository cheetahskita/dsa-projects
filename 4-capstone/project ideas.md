# Captstone Project

## Preliminary Questions

* Can we add blood pressure to the model? Where is blood pressure stored in the database?

* Do we want to research something other than congestive heart failure?

* Can we add unsupervised learning?

* Can we start with a rough model and then dial down?

* Can we add time series analysis as a feature?

* Add ethical component to post.
